A machine learning-powered web application that predicts gender from images with up to 98.5% accuracy. A robust and user-friendly web application for real-time gender detection..

Project Highlights:
🔍 Objective: Build a robust and user-friendly web application for real-time gender detection.

⚙️ Algorithm: The application leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a labeled dataset of facial images to classify gender.

🛠️ Tech Stack and Tools Used:
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Backend: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dynamic image preview) yeah the design is not that grt, but hey!!! it's a good start though 😅😋
Image Processing: OpenCV for pre-processing images
Deployment Environment: Local system setup for testing and Flask server hosting

💻 Key Features:
Simple and clean UI with gradient backgrounds and responsive design
Dynamic image preview feature before submission
Processes and classifies uploaded images in real-time
Outputs both predicted gender and confidence score

🧩 Platforms:
Model Training and Development: Jupyter Notebook
Testing and Deployment: Flask and local server
This project not only enhanced my understanding of machine learning model deployment but also taught me how to create an intuitive user interface that ensures seamless interaction.

🎯 What’s Next?
I aim to enhance the model’s accuracy further by training it on a more diverse dataset and deploying it on cloud platforms for usage, but for now that's it.
