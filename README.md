# GENVID – Real-Time Gender Detection Web Application

## 🚀 Overview
GENVID is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts gender from images with up to **98.5% accuracy**. This project challenged me to merge technical expertise with creative design, and I’m excited to share the results! 🎉

## 🔍 Objective
Develop a **robust and user-friendly** web application for **real-time gender detection**.

## ⚙️ Algorithm
The application utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a labeled dataset of facial images to classify gender.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dynamic image preview)
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV for pre-processing images
- **Deployment:** Flask server (local setup for testing)

## 💻 Key Features
✅ **Simple and Clean UI** – Gradient backgrounds with a responsive layout  
✅ **Dynamic Image Preview** – Allows users to preview images before submission  
✅ **Real-Time Processing** – Uploads and classifies images instantly  
✅ **Accuracy & Confidence Score** – Displays the predicted gender along with confidence levels  

## 🧩 Platforms Used
- **Model Training and Development:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Testing and Deployment:** Flask and local server

This project not only strengthened my understanding of **machine learning model deployment**, but also taught me how to design an intuitive UI for a seamless user experience.

## 🎯 What’s Next?
I plan to:
- Improve the model’s accuracy with a more diverse dataset
- Deploy the application on cloud platforms for public access
